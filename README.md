# Pip-Boy 3018

![fallout_pipboy_screen](http://pipboy.fedirko.pro/reference_live.gif)

Your personal Pip-Boy for your Raspberry Pi with touchscreen (or any OS/web).

Live demo here - http://pipboy.fedirko.pro

Designed for 5 inch touch screen (800 x 480 px).

Initially idea is to have Pip-Boy software on Raspberry Pi with some general information available in original game (Fallout 3/4/etc.).

MVP functionality should consist of:
- initial loading screen with video
- tabs with static general info about common character
- fallout styled google map
- Radio tab with possibility to play music
- etc.

You can request additional functionality via small donation :)

Feel free to use and modify it :)
