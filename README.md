# Pip-Boy 3018

Your personal Pip-Boy for your Raspberry Pi with touchscreen (or any OS/web).

Designed for 5 inch touch screen (800 x 480 px).

Initially idea is to have Pip-Boy software on Raspberry Pi with some general information available in original game (Fallout 3/4/etc.).

MVP functionality should consist of:
- initial loading screen with video
- tabs with static general info about common character
- Radio tab with possibility to play music
- etc.
